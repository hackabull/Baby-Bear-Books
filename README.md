This is the first in what could become a series of interactive storyboooks meant for parents and kids to spend screen time together in a fun and defined way.

Type in your own name on the first pages of the book and follow along as you visit animals at the zoo.

This site has the look and feel of a book: images that take up the entire page and pages that "flip" on the next page click. Readers drag and drop images to move the plot of the story forward. Each book is short enough to be read in ten minutes. We are envisioning a new genre of learning tools that both educate kids and give parents a chance to connect with their children on a shared screen for a capped amount of time.
