This is the first in what could become a series of interactive storybooks meant for parents and kids to read together. We are envisioning a new genre of learning tools that both educate kids and give parents a chance to connect with their children on a shared screen for a capped amount of time. 

Type in your own name on the first pages of the book and follow along as you visit animals at the zoo.

This site has the look and feel of a book: large, colorful images and pages that "flip" on the next page click. Readers drag and drop images to move the plot of the story forward. Each book is short enough to be read in ten minutes. 

# Technologies
