We are building a interactive storybook meant for parents and kids to spend screen time together in a fun and defined way. We want it to have the look and feel of a book: images that take up the entire page and "flip" on the next page click.

# Why Valuable
- New bedtime story that are short enough to be done after 10 minutes
- There are a lot of crap apps for kids that doesn't teach them anything
- Adoptable to series
- New genre of learning tools

# Planned Technologies
React
Bootstrap for column layout
HTML
SCSS
SVG images
MongoDB: User log-ins
NPM Flip Page: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-flip-page
Drag and Drop built in React
